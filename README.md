# Hand_Sign_Recognition

ðŸ“Œ Overview

Hand Sign Recognition is a computer vision-based project developed to recognize and interpret hand gestures in real-time using a webcam. This project is especially useful for bridging communication gaps for individuals with speech or hearing impairments, providing a foundation for gesture-based interfaces and assistive technologies.

ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

To recognize hand gestures using image processing and machine learning.

To convert recognized hand signs into meaningful output (e.g., text or voice).

To build an interactive, real-time system using a webcam.

ðŸ”§ Tech Stack

Technology	Usage
Python	Core programming language
OpenCV	Image capturing & processing
MediaPipe	Hand tracking and landmark detection
NumPy	Numerical operations
TensorFlow/Keras	Model training (if used)
Streamlit (Optional)	Frontend deployment (if applicable)

ðŸ“· Sample Features

Real-time webcam capture

Hand landmark detection (e.g., 21 key points)

Static gesture recognition

Dynamic gesture detection (if implemented)

Optional: Text-to-speech conversion for recognized signs

ðŸš€ How to Run

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/SanketMahajan2004/Hand_Sign_Recognition.git
cd Hand_Sign_Recognition

Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the application:
python app.py

If you're using Streamlit:
streamlit run app.py
Make sure your webcam is connected and accessible.

ðŸ§  Future Enhancements

Add more hand signs (e.g., full ASL/ISL support)

Integrate with speech output

Improve accuracy using deep learning models

Deploy on web or mobile platforms
